This is a test to see if everything goes as plan. At first I just write some text, so I can readthis in.
Possible I want something that detects different paragraphs as well as here. Finally I want to to pick up if I talk about a big home on a big mountain. And if I say big here once more I want it to somehow pont this out.
Maybe I also want it to notify me if I am stupid and mess up my comma's with my dialogue. So, "You win," Jan screams. Is good but. You win." Jan screams is wrong. But I have no idea how to handle that.
